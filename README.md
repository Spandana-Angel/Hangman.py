Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to identify a hidden word by guessing individual letters. The game is a mix of problem-solving and luck, and it often involves two players: one who chooses the word and the other who guesses. In this Python version of the game, the computer selects a word randomly from a predefined list, and the player guesses letters to uncover it.

 Key Features:
Attempts: The player starts with 6 wrong guesses allowed. Each incorrect guess reduces the available attempts by one.
Input Validation: The game checks for invalid inputs like numbers, multiple characters, or already-guessed letters, prompting the player to input a valid guess.
Word List: The game draws words from a predefined list that can be expanded or customized.
